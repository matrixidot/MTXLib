Make an IRegisterable interface and have a universal class for registering any IRegisterable thing.
Then we can have a universal Register and Unregister event that returns an IRegisterable. These can also be user defined.


How to store registered things. List in Registering class maybe?
- Of type Registerable then conform the type using the get method
